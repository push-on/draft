  - The city is always alive and changing. From the skyscrapers to the drones flying overhead, technology is everywhere. The people are so diverse, each one unique in their own way. I wonder what kind of stories they all have to tell. It's amazing to see how far we've come as a society, but at the same time, I can't help but think about the potential consequences of all this technology. Will it bring us closer together or push us further apart? As I reach college, I'm reminded of my own purpose, to create technology that will better humanity.

  - "Tech everywhere, huh?"
  "People, everywhere too"
  "What stories do they hide?"
  "So far, so good. But at what cost?"
  "Time to make a difference"
