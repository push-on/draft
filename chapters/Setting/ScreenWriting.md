Jack: "I've been working on this AI project for years, but I need someone with your expertise to help me take it to the next level."

Sophie: "I left my high-paying job to pursue my passion for AI. I'm excited to work with you on this project."

The Cabal: "We have been watching you, Jack. We know what you're working on, and we will stop at nothing to prevent you from completing your project."

Jack: "I can't believe it. The Cabal is after us. We have to finish this project before they catch us."

Sophie: "We'll finish it together. I believe in you, Jack."

Jack: "Sophie, I have feelings for you. I know you're in a relationship, but I just had to tell you."

Sophie: "Jack, I'm flattered but I'm with someone. I hope we can still work together."

Jack: "I understand. Let's focus on the project."

Sophie: "I broke up with my boyfriend. I don't know what to do."

Jack: "I'm here for you, Sophie. Let's take on the Cabal and change the world together."

Jack: "Sophie, I have something to tell you. I've finished the AI project and we did it together."
