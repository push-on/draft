For Nietzsche, philosophy was not, as he put it, a critique of words by means of other words. Instead, for Nietzsche, philosophy had a definite practical purpose that being to facilitate the emergence of the great individual who dedicates their life to growth and self-overcoming. Nietzsche believed that such a pursuit would provide one with the ability to completely affirm life in the face of suffering, pain and tragedy.

"There are heights of the soul from which even tragedy ceases to look tragic," wrote Nietzsche and in Beyond Good and Evil the great individual attains these heights. Nietzsche viewed himself as the educator of such a great individual whom he called the higher man. For this reason, he saw himself as writing not for the masses but for the potential higher man alone. "These alone are my readers, my rightful readers, my predestined readers. What do the rest matter the rest are merely mankind," he said.

The higher man, Nietzsche maintained, is separated from the rest of mankind by the constitution of his internal being. Within the higher man exists an array of powerful and potent drives engaged in a continual battle with each other. The higher man, in other words, is a chaotic being who is in constant war with himself and therefore one who suffers deeply and is always in danger of self-destructing. In order to attain greatness and the ability to affirm life, Nietzsche believed that the higher man must impose order on his internal chaos. This is his life's mission: "To become master of the Chaos one is.. that is the grand ambition here"

However, because he suffers so deeply from the chaos that he is, there exists the possibility that the higher man will evade his life's mission and instead, seek out the comforts of mediocrity via conformity. Nietzsche postulated that within every individual exists a herd instinct that is an innate need to obey and conform to the masses. Individuals satiate this need by obeying the accepted morality that is the designation of what is good and what is evil of one's culture.

Morality is the best of all devices for leading mankind by the nose proclaimed Nietzsche in The Antichrist. Such a morality since it is accepted by the masses Nietzsche called herd morality. Nietzsche maintained that herd morality serves a clear purpose, it instills in mediocre individuals the conviction that their weakness is not a fault but instead strength. "Verily I have often laughed at the weaklings who thought themselves good because they had no claws," Nietzsche wrote in Thus Spoke Zarathustra. On the other hand, herd morality maintains that those qualities which the herd lacks are evil as Nietzsche put it. Therefore, with herd morality as Nietzsche amusingly quipped the sheep gains in respect. Since sheep-like qualities are championed by herd morality as being good, herd morality pressures individuals into becoming good that is weak and obedient. The higher man, if he is to achieve greatness, must escape the clutches of herd morality and renounce it in favor of his own self-created and life-affirming morality.

In order to escape from the herd and live according to his own life-affirming morality, Nietzsche thought it was essential for the higher man to separate himself physically from the herd and live a life of solitude. Nietzsche believed that out of fear and laziness the masses structure their lives who has to blind

 themselves to the deep questions of human existence. If the higher man is to achieve greatness in life, he must contemplate questions which the herd is too weak and scared to ponder and to do this, he needs his solitude. According to Nietzsche, the deepest questions one can ask in life are "why do I live and why do I suffer?" The higher man must confront these questions head-on in order to truly understand the meaning of life and to achieve greatness.

In addition to these ideas, Nietzsche also wrote about the concept of the overman (or Superman) as the ultimate goal of human evolution and the idea of eternal recurrence, the belief that life is endlessly repeating itself. He also emphasized the importance of embracing fate or "amor fati" as a means of affirming life and overcoming suffering.

In conclusion, Nietzsche's philosophy centers around the idea of the higher man and the need for individuals to impose order on their internal chaos in order to achieve greatness and the ability to affirm life. He rejected herd morality and instead advocated for a self-created, life-affirming morality. The higher man must separate himself physically from the herd and live a life of solitude in order to contemplate the deep questions of human existence. He must strive to become the overman, embrace fate and overcome suffering in order to truly understand the meaning of life.
